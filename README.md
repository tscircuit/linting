# @tscircuit/linting

Common code conventions make coding easier, especially when those convetions
are standardized across projects.

tscircuit has strict conventions available for projects that are becoming
more mature and may start accepting external contribution. Generally if there
isn't a project policy, then maintainers should not enforce a policy- that is,
if you want to make stylistic choices, they should be enforced by a linter,
not in code review.
